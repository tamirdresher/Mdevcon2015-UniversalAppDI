It\u2019s the point at which the normal, standard-issue human being becomes a coder or becomes someone who \u201c\u201dtried programming\u201d\"". For almost all, the journey to this point is different. What causes them to decide to either become a professional programmer, or get that degree in English is likely the quality of the computer science education that they\u2019ve experienced.\n\nIn this fast-paced, very funny and occasionally touching keynote, Mark Lassoff, reflects back on 12 years of teaching hundreds of live classroom students, and over 200,000 students online. The conclusion: Computer Science Education is Broken\u2013 But Can Be Fixed. As an advocate of egalitarianism and inclusion in computer science, Mark will do a \u201c\u201dtake-down\u201d\"" of current methods of CS education, and, explore what could be done to improve CS education at all levels.\n\nThis is a discussion that all developers need to have, as we look towards a much more internationalized future. Developing countries are turning out programmers by the thousands. In Europe and the US the \u201c\u201ddeveloper shortage\u201d\"" is being backfilled by developers from places thousands of miles away. Can Europe and the US change their educational methods to create more and better developers? Can we start including more women and underrepresented minorities to round out the developer ranks?\n\nMark\u2019s keynote may not provide all the answers, but will certainly raise important questions about computer science education and how we might positively impact the future of our profession.\n\n"",""type"":""Keynote"",""startDate"":""2015-03-06T09:00:00+01:00"",""duration"":50,""stub"":""a13f5"",""averageRating"":0,""commentsEnabled"":0,""commentCount"":0,""starred"":false,""starredCount"":0,""speakers"":[{""speakerName"":""Mark Lassoff""}],""uri"":""https:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/13692"",""verboseUri"":""https:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/13692?verbose=yes"",""websiteUri"":""http:\/\/joind.in\/talk\/view\/13692"",""commentsUri"":""https:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/13692\/comments"",""starredUri"":""https:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/13692\/starred"",""verboseCommentsUri"":""https:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/talks\/13692\/comments?verbose=yes"",""eventUri"":""https:\/\/api.joind.in\/v2.1\/events\/3463"",""platforms"":[""windows"",""ios"",""android""]},{""talkTitle"":""Death to Passwords"",""urlFriendlyTalkTitle"":""death-to-passwords"",""talkDescription"":""User authentication in mobile applications is a very common and integral use case.

We welcome independent developers, \nfreelancers and developers working for a company \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter \nwho you are or where you work, if you work with mobile technology \nyou\u2019ll enjoy this conference. <br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Location<\/b><br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Tutorial day:<\/b> NH Carlton (near Rembrandt Plein) <br\/>\nVijzelstraat 4<br\/>\nAmsterdam <br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Conference day:<\/b> Tuschinski Theater (near Rembrandt Plein) <br\/>\nReguliersbreestraat 26 <br\/>\nAmsterdam <br\/>\n<br\/>\nThere\u2019s one place where a mobile developer conference makes perfect sense: <b>Appsterdam.<\/b> \nFounded by Mike Lee, appsterdam is a growing European community of app developers located \nin or near Amsterdam. Visit the <a href=\""http:\/\/appsterdam.rs\/\"">Appsterdam website<\/a> for more information about this vibrant \ncommunity of developers or to become a member. The conference is open to a world wide \naudience and we hope it will be an opportunity for many developers to get a sense of \nthe great atmosphere in Appsterdam! <br\/>\n<br\/>\nAs for the venue, we looked hard to find a location that is easy to reach but also inspiring. \nThe conference will be held in the Tuschinski Theater. According to wikipedia it is \n\u2018considered one of the most beautiful cinemas in the world\u2019. This means that we\u2019ll not \nonly have presentations literally on the big screen, it means we\u2019ll have comfy chairs \nto enjoy the conference. We were also very interested in this venue because of its \nexcellent \u2018hallway track\u2019. This unofficial track in between or during sessions where you \nmeet other developers and speakers is just as valuable as the main content tracks, \nand Tuschinski is a great place to talk to people or to just hang out.\n""}";
