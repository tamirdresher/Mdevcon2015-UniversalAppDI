A series of DNS queries to discover the right IP address to speak to, TCP making sure your app receives the complete response in the right order, a routing infrastructure to guide the packets to and from the servers, and much more.\n\nAs important as all these underlying processes are, they are often not well understood by developers. Sometimes their intricacies can cause issues for your users, and understanding them better can make debugging easier. In this session, you\u2019ll get an understanding of the stack that underlies your apps and how they can affect your work.\n\nAs there's so much to talk about, most of this session is interactive: through a slightly democratic process you get to decide what we're going to cover. Will we cover more subjects briefly, or will we go for the routing extravaganza? It's up to you!\n\nAbout Erik:\n\nErik Romijn is an independent app maker, making anything from APIs to iOS apps in independent projects and freelance work.

We welcome independent developers, freelancers\nand developers working for a company \u2013 It doesn\u2019t matter who you are or where\nyou work, if you work with API technology you\u2019ll enjoy this conference. <br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Location<\/b><br\/>\n<br\/>\n<b>Tuschinski Theater <\/b> (near Rembrandt Plein) <br\/>\nReguliersbreestraat 26 <br\/>\nAmsterdam <br\/>\n<br\/>\nWe organize all our conferences in the most inspiring community for developers:\nAppsterdam. Founded by Mike Lee, appsterdam is a growing European community of\napp developers located in or near Amsterdam. Visit the <a href=\""http:\/\/appsterdam.rs\/\"">Appsterdam website<\/a>\nfor more information about this vibrant community of developers or to become a member.\nThe conference is open to a world wide audience and we hope it will be an\nopportunity for many developers to get a sense of the great atmosphere in Appsterdam!<br\/>\n<br\/>\nAs for the venue, we looked hard to find a location that is easy to reach but also inspiring. \nThe conference will be held in the Tuschinski Theater. According to wikipedia it is \n\u2018considered one of the most beautiful cinemas in the world\u2019. This means that we\u2019ll not \nonly have presentations literally on the big screen, it means we\u2019ll have comfy chairs \nto enjoy the conference. We were also very interested in this venue because of its \nexcellent \u2018hallway track\u2019. This unofficial track in between or during sessions where you \nmeet other developers and speakers is just as valuable as the main content tracks, \nand Tuschinski is a great place to talk to people or to just hang out.\n"",""description"":""Endpoint is a conference by and for API and backend developers. It caters to PHP, Python, Ruby and other developers and focuses on API design, best practices, tools and coding techniques.""}";
