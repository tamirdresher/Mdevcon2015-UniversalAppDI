The universal Windows app approach allows you to develop using a unified programming model and IDE (Visual Studio) that will lead to apps that can be published to the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store.\nParticipants of this session will learn the fundamentals of developing universal Windows apps with Visual Studio, based on the C#\/XAML framework of the Windows Runtime. A practical approach will be taken, creating an app that will leverage the core platform and UI as well as advanced scenarios such as file and database storage, network and sensor interaction, tiles, notifications and background operations. Extending this architecture into cross-platform app development towards iOS and Android devices will also be on the agenda, explaining how Xamarin as a platform can help streamline development across multiple platforms and devices.\n\nKey takeaways of this session:\n\nHaving the knowledge of universal Windows app development fundamentals\nBeing able to decide on the application architecture to streamline development\nUnderstanding how to extend the base application architecture to other platforms and devices.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nKnowledge:\n\n- Basic understanding of application programming, preferably in C# and XAML\n- Understanding core concepts of mobile app development (asynchronous, mobile design, sensors, low power\/battery consumption)\n\nTechnology:\n\n- A PC\/Mac running Windows 8.1, virtual machines acceptable with certain constraints * (Evaluation version available at https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/evalcenter\/hh699156.aspx)\n- Visual Studio Community 2013 or better (http:\/\/www.visualstudio.com\/en-us\/news\/vs2013-community-vs.aspx).\n- Xamarin Platform (trial available at http:\/\/xamarin.com\/download)\n\n*) Running in a virtual machine may prohibit the use of the Windows Phone emulator when using certain technologies\n\nPlatforms: ios, android, win",

It\u2019s a clear, clean language that looks like a strongly typed version of Python. Experienced developers can learn the language quickly, while new developers will find the language clear enough to create their first lines of code.\n\nIn this session, Mark Lassoff, best selling author of Swift Fundamentals: The Language of iOS will go over the basics of the Swift Programming language and how the language can be used to create iOS Applications. Participants will be encouraged to code-along with the presenter as they create three basic apps during the course: The Chuck Norris Joke Generator, A \u201c\u201dNext Train\u201d\" App and a simple game.\n\nParticipants will leave with better command of the Swift Programming Language and be positioned to transition to Swift and iOS Native development after the workshop.\n\nPlatforms: ios",
